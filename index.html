I developed my love for coding and creating after participating in the All Star Code Intensive Program the summer after my sophomore year of high school. Shortly after completing it, I decided to build this website to keep track of all of my projects and passions. Happy browsing!</p>

I learned so many skills ranging from how to program my own personal website from scratch(you're looking at it right now) to the differnt ways to tie and tie. Although it was over Zoom due to COVID rather than the normal JP Morgan in Brooklyn setting, I will never forget it for the rest of my life.  </p>

The gameplay is simple: two players try to block the bouncing ball from going past their bar that they move up and down. Whichever player lets the ball pass their bar first loses.</p>
